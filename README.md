# BubbleSort-Visualiation
A graphic visualization of the Bubble Sort sorting algorithm created in python using the 2D graphics module pygame

## Images:
### When the program is intially run, an array of tower objects are generated with random heights. Their shade of green is associated with their heights with the shorter towers having a higher green value in their RGB (appears brighter) and taller towers having a lower green value in their RGB (appears darker).

### When the user clicks anywhere on the window, the array of towers is sorted using the bubble sort algorithm. Between each iteration of the sort, there is a small delay (customizable) to allow the user to visually see the array get sorted. Once the array of towers is fully sorted, the towers will appear in increasing order with their shades of green going from light to dark.
